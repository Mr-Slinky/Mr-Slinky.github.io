  <p>“Conditional statements” broadly refers to if and switch statements.
Understanding boolean expressions, along with conditional and boolean operators,
is vital before we can understand conditional statements.
Conditional statements work with boolean expressions.  Remember from Java 101
that boolean expressions are like math equations, where the answer can only be
true or false. Conditional statements hold code inside of their own scope, just
like a method or a class.  In contrast, however, these statements only run the
code inside of them if a certain condition is true. If and switch statements
cannot be named, and so must be placed within a method. They cannot be placed
within the scope of a class only!
Conditions refer to boolean expressions which ultimately evaluate to true or
false, such as is seven bigger than nine? (7>9). Seven is not bigger than nine,
and so this condition\expression is false.<br/>
